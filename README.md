# ChordFinder
Chordbook written in Java using Netbeans

This a project I wrote in high school largely for fun and to prove I could.
It is also the first coding project I ever took on by myself outside of class.

The chordbook is a standalone desktop application that is designed for beginner musicians 
to learn about (and play) chords in different keys.

Sounds for the notes were recorded using musecores

These were my original installation instructions. Sorry it's a little clunky:

INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS
easy enough, just paste the ChordFinder Folder into your Program Files. The URI should read:
C:\Program Files\ChordFinder
For whatever reason, the key of C# doesn't work with flat seven chords so it automatically goes to Db. 
Sorry.
If the exe fails to work, either:
1) Check your that your JVM is up to date
2) Run the Jar file that exists within the ChordFinder folder. It should work on its own.
